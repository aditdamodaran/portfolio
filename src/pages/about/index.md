Heya! I’m Adit (“uh-dit”). I’m a software engineer, photographer, writer, and avid roadtripper. **Currently, I’m looking for full-time positions.**

I graduated from the University of Chicago in Dec. 2019 with a BA in Economics and a specialization in Data Science. I'm working on my Master’s in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

I most recently worked as an **economist** at [Hopper](https://www.hopper.com/), but am looking for my next opportunity [a bit early due to Covid-19](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adit-damodaran-1a0245108_covid19-chicago-classof2020-activity-6658772356833648641-994u). During my brief time at Hopper, I developed a report on how Covid-19 would affect U.S. & Canadian flight operations and airfare, and created data visualizations to help the communications team understand the scope of cancellations across major U.S. airports and carriers.

Prior to that, I worked as a **software engineering intern** at [Digitas](https://www.digitas.com/en-us) for the Intel account. I was also an undergraduate **VC intern** with [Chicago Ventures](http://chicagoventures.com/), and a **marketing intern** alongside the amazing team at the [Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/).

On campus at UChicago, **I led** [Midway Ventures](http://www.midwayvc.com/), a student-run startup consulting group that teaches undergraduates about venture capital financing. I built the Midway website myself during the summer of 2018.

# What I Believe

- *I believe anything can be taught to anyone. I think of education as a matter of work ethic, accessibility, and privilege—not innate talent.*

- *I believe discomfort is the greatest motivator. I tend to get complacent when I’m happy with where I am.*

- *I believe in humility. In high-school, I worked at McDonald’s between classes, extracurriculars, and applying to college. Working in the service industry was one of the most humbling experiences of my life.*

- *I believe in acceptance. My parents were immigrants to the U.S., and throughout my childhood I watched their sacrifices manifest into opportunities for their children. Regardless of your race, religion, color, or creed, I believe you belong here.*

- *I believe in open-source and giving credit where it is due. Open source has helped me become the coder I am today. However, I strongly stand against plagiarism and will credit others' contributions in my own work.*
