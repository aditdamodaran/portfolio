**NOTE: The Subli Landing Page is not yet LIVE**

 Subli, the 2020 UChicago College New Venture Challenge winner, is a student-run startup that made a free peer-to-peer marketplace to find and list student housing. I worked with Subli to design and develop a landing page that would emphasize their brand's simplicity and honesty while increasing conversions.
