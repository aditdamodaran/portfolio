[Andre is a 2020 EuroNASCAR E-Series Champion.](https://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2020/07/andre-castros-euronascar-esports-title-gives-df1-early-advantage-in-nwes-teams-championship/)

Andre, a first-generation Colombian-American racecar driver, has been behind the wheel since he was seven. Even with limited resources and the added challenge of growing up in New York City, Andre has persevered to become one of the top young drivers from the United States, advancing to become a finalist for the 2016 Team USA Scholarship.

I met Andre back in 2018, when he was looking for sponsorships to continue on the Mazda Road to Indy USF2000 Series. Last year he proved to be a front-runner in the 2019 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series with PK Carsport, and this year amid the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic won the EuroNascar E-Series Championship with DF1 Racing. I built Andre's website to help sponsors and racing teams better understand his potential and talent.

<div class="subtitle image-100">The site uses CSS Grid for a responsive news section that is easy to skim for up-to-date content.</div>

Since I needed to make the site easy to update for someone non-technical, I opted for the **Netlify CMS** under **Gatsby v2**. The site's front-end is developed with **React** and **SASS**, which makes reusing common components a breeze.

Thanks to Gatsby, the site performs well with SEO and loads really quickly.
