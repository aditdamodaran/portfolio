  title: Heya! I’m Adit.
  description1: >
    I’m a software engineer, web designer, photographer, writer, and avid roadtripper. I most recently worked as an Economist at Hopper, but am looking for my next opportunity a bit early due to Covid-19.  
  description2: >
    I graduated from the University of Chicago in Dec. 2019 with a B.A. in Economics and a specialization in Data Science. In Aug. 2020, I’ll begin my Online Master’s in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
  description3: >
    During my brief time at Hopper, I developed a report on how Covid-19 would affect U.S. & Canadian flight operations and airfare, and created data visualizations to help the communications team understand the scope of cancellations across major U.S. airports and carriers.
  description4: >
    Prior to that, I worked as a software engineering intern at Digitas for the Intel account. I was also an undergraduate VC Intern with Chicago Ventures, and a Marketing/Design Intern alongside the amazing team at the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

        Intel-Point-of-Sale (2019)
      text: >
        During the summer of 2019, I had the privilege of working with the amazing Technology team at Digitas in Chicago as a Front-End Software Engineering Intern. During my time at Digitas, I worked on Intel’s “Intelligent Point of Sale (IPOS)” software. IPOS enables retail shoppers to learn about and explore the capabilities of Intel devices without the pressure of a salesperson. The software, which is installed on thousands of devices in computer showrooms around the world, automatically detects the system specifications of the device and displays this information in an easy-to-understand, interactive experience that educates the shopper. Additionally, a cloud-based admin panel allows retailers to control and modify hundreds of devices at a time, enabling them to customize prices, promotions, and branding.

        Chicago Ventures Sales Navigator Scraper (2019)
      text: >
        LinkedIn describes Sales Navigator as “a leading social selling tool that enables sales professionals to build and nurture customer relationships and attain increased sales performance.” Sales Navigator is a paid-subscription service. I built, shipped, and maintained software to scrape ~100 results/minute for any given filter on Sales Navigator, helping Chicago Ventures automate a previously manual and tedious process.

        Andre Castro Racing (2020)
      text: >
        Andre Castro is a first-generation Colombian-American racecar driver. I met Andre back in 2018, when he was looking for sponsorships to continue on the Mazda Road to Indy USF2000 Series. Last year he proved to be a front-runner in the 2019 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series with PK Carsport, and this year amid the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic he has continued to excel in EuroNascar's E-Series with DF1 Racing. I built Andre's website to help sponsors and racing teams better understand his potential and talent.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
