        Intel, Intelligent-Point-of-Sale (2019)
      text: >
        During the summer of 2019, I had the privilege of working with the amazing Technology team at Digitas in Chicago as a Front-End Software Engineering Intern. During my time at Digitas, I worked on Intel’s “Intelligent Point of Sale (IPOS)” software. IPOS enables retail shoppers to learn about and explore the capabilities of Intel devices without the pressure of a salesperson. The software, which is installed on thousands of devices in computer showrooms around the world, automatically detects the system specifications of the device and displays this information in an easy-to-understand, interactive experience that educates the shopper. Additionally, a cloud-based admin panel allows retailers to control and modify hundreds of devices at a time, enabling them to customize prices, promotions, and branding.

        Chicago Ventures Sales Navigator Scraper (2019)
      text: >
        LinkedIn describes Sales Navigator as “a leading social selling tool that enables sales professionals to build and nurture customer relationships and attain increased sales performance.” Sales Navigator is a paid-subscription service. I built, shipped, and maintained software to scrape ~100 results/minute for any given filter on Sales Navigator, helping Chicago Ventures automate a previously manual and tedious process.

        Andre Castro Racing (2020)
      text: >
        Andre Castro is a first-generation Colombian-American racecar driver and 2020 EuroNASCAR Champion. I met Andre back in 2018, when he was looking for sponsorships to continue on the Mazda Road to Indy USF2000 Series. Last year he proved to be a front-runner in the 2019 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series with PK Carsport, and this year amid the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic won the EuroNascar E-Series Championship with DF1 Racing. I built Andre's website to help sponsors and racing teams better understand his potential and talent.
