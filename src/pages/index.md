  title: Heya! I’m Adit.
  description1: >
    I’m a software engineer, web designer, photographer, writer, and avid roadtripper. I most recently worked as an Economist at Hopper, but am looking for my next opportunity a bit early due to Covid-19.  
  description2: >
    I graduated from the University of Chicago in Dec. 2019 with a B.A. in Economics and a specialization in Data Science. In Aug. 2020, I’ll begin my Online Master’s in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
  description3: >
    During my brief time at Hopper, I developed a report on how Covid-19 would affect U.S. & Canadian flight operations and airfare, and created data visualizations to help the communications team understand the scope of cancellations across major U.S. airports and carriers.

    Prior to that, I worked as a software engineering intern at Digitas for the Intel account. I was also an undergraduate VC Intern with Chicago Ventures, and a Marketing/Design Intern alongside the amazing team at the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
