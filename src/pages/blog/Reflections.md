I haven't blogged in a while (over a month). It's 5AM and I haven't been able to catch any Z's, so I figured I'd hop on here and take some time to reflect. 

### Reflect on What?

I wish I could articulate it better. Life? 

It's now about 6 months into this global pandemic, and I keep telling myself "when I have some sort of interesting professional update, I'll write a blog post". I feel the need to prequalify my experiences through the lens of employment. If I'm employed at "X", my opinions about "Y" matter more. I suppose this is because of my own bias towards valuing others' experiences if they have achieved what I seek from my own life. And being conscious of that is I think the first step towards better valuing both my own lived experience, and also those of many who are less fortunate than me. 

So I'm reflecting on career stuff (unemployment) and a bit from my personal life. 

### Career Related Stuff

I had a video interview come up for an entry-level Software Engineering position at a startup out in SF around mid-August. The company did a wonderful job conducting the interviews, and I'll always appreciate their kindness for looking through my portfolio and offering me useful feedback on how to improve afterwards. Unfortunately it didn't work out, but I am more aware of my weaknesses as a developer and keen on improving. If anything, the failure to secure the position has reaffirmed to me that I do have a growth mindset. My first instinct was "Shoot, I'll go back and prepare better for the next one." Specifically in the coming weeks I hope to sharpen my knowledge of React Hooks and the Context API. 

My most recent labor of love has been [Cloudy Day Club](https://www.cloudyday.club/), a colorful web player for Spotify. I've learned a lot in making it, and even more in optimizing it and getting feedback from friends. I hope you'll give it a shot if you're reading this and have Spotify Premium. 

In full disclosure, right now I'm trying to find a balance between what I am passionate about and enjoy (frontend software dev), and the shifting needs of the job market (as well as my seemingly unrelated Economics undergraduate degree). I know that I can dedicate serious time to gradually getting better at software development, and that I'll be able to build a career out of it someday. At the same time, I'd like to be able to move into my own place soon and begin working towards financial independence. I hope to find the right path forward soon, without compromising on what I want from my life. 

### Personal Life (Politics)

I think the political state of the United States has me generally fatigued. I remember four years ago being such an outspoken and vocal high-school student in my support for Sanders and later Clinton (particularly as a person of color from Tennessee). Today, I'm a lot more soft-spoken. I don't think it's because my views of what is *right* and what is *wrong* have changed, but rather the nagging anxiety that expressing my political opinion could <u>offend</u> someone who could help me out (whether by hiring me, referring me, etc.). Hell, I suppose a potential or former employer could be reading this post. It's on the web anyways.

I look up a lot to Lewis Hamilton, Naomi Osaka, and Colin Kaepernick, who have used their platforms as a voice for racial equality and justice in the United States. I'm heartbroken and infuriated by the privileged posts on social media asking them to "just be quiet about politics and play the game", as if politics doesn't touch every fiber of who we are, how safe we feel, and the rights we have. How can sports administrations have commercial sponsors (i.e. Saudi Aramco) who are deeply invested in geopolitics, but simultaneously seek to silence the political expression of its players? 

And that's made me realize that if I don't stand *for* something, I stand *on* nothing. I've thus chosen to personally err on the side of "offending" those with privilege, and I'll seek to amplify the voices of those who are seeking a better world. 

### Personal Life (Sports)

On a separate note, F1 has been a sort of saving grace of the quarantine. I loved watching Gasly get his first win with AlphaTauri, and I look forward to watching Hamilton pass Schumacher's record to become one of the greatest drivers of all time üêê.

### Personal Life (Life Itself)

I've been chugging through the Master's in CS program (I delve deeper into my experience in some of my other blog posts). Things are going great there, and I'm on track for an A.

Unrelated -- I keep telling myself that I'll do "more" when I have steady employment. I'll experiment more with cooking, delve deeper into my hobbies, travel more, and somehow relax *more*. As if I'll have *more* time when I'm balancing a 40 hour/wk job and a 10-20hr/wk Master's. 

In some sense I can see why. When I had a place of my own in Boston with an income, I felt like I had aligned *most* of the puzzle pieces in my life. I could definitely make improvements (i.e. a less noisy apartment with much more natural light), but I was on the right "path" (and I had affirmation from family and friends that made me feel good about it). I was comfortable with my work, and that let me feel experiences outside of work much more deeply and fully.

Now I'm in this weird phase where I feel like instead of *wanting* to do more, I feel like I'm never <u>doing enough</u>. I've never applied to enough jobs, I'm not spending enough time on my coursework, or prepping for coding interviews, or building side projects. I think that impedes my ability to even enjoy simpler moments, like drinking a cup of coffee or watching a movie. Honestly, I've struggled to even read books without that persistent thought of a more "productive" way to spend my time. It always feels like I should be doing something *more* to move myself forward. 

I'm trying to be more present in the moment. I don't know what that really looks like yet in more concrete terms. I think writing a blog post at 5AM reflecting on life counts? I hope it's a start.
